**Lesson's topic:**

Firebase

**Task:**

Create a chat application.
1) There are 2 users in the chat who have a hardcoded username and password. When you enter the application for the first time - you need to login with a username and password. There is a “Remember” checkbox, if you click it then next 5 times - you don't need to login.
2) After login a chat screen appears. There you can write messages and read, scroll through the chat.
3) There is an “Unlogin” button, when you click it - empty login screen appears.
4) Login and password are stored in Firebase.

**Result: Screen recoding** (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
